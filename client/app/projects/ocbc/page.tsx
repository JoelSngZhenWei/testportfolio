                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                    OCBC was facing the issue of not having enough reach with PMETs (persons with 2-10 years of working experience). They engaged my University to understand if there were possible opportunities in this demographic. 
                    <br /><br />
                    In our primary research, me and my peers identified that there were customers willing to switch for better benefits, which OCBC provided, but they chose not to because of inconvenience.
                    <br /><br />
                    While this was my business capstone project, I chose to leverage my competitive advantage as an Information Systems student to drive a technology solution to this business problem.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-3">Our Solution:</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                    To maximise convenience and encourage customers who currently had relationships with other banks to recognise the benefits of OCBC products and make the switch, I designed and developed an <strong>AI Financial Assistant</strong>.
                    <br /><br />
                    The application, powered by <strong>Gemini Pro</strong>, would prompt users for specific lifestyle information, financial goals, and big ticket expenses they foresaw in their near future.
                    <br /><br />
                    The applications gives a tailored recommendation on what products (savings accounts, deposit accounts, loans, insurance, securities etc) from OCBC that the user can consider to adopt, along with links to learn more about these products.

                                        The application was developed using Gemini Pro as the LLM. This offered a efficient, versatile, and cost-effective AI model.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        It was my first time working with a generate AI API, thankfully due to extensive documentation online I was able to integrate it into my application.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Comprehensive OCBC product data was obtained using OCBC APIs. Only publicly available OCBC information was fed into the LLM prompt.
